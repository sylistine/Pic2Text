# Pic2Text

A simple app that takes any png or jpg fed into it and converts it into ascii art.

# TODO

* Add support for color text with curses
* Add a sample shell function that can be added to a .bashrc etc. to display the image at runtime
* Add support to declare the source image via commandline
